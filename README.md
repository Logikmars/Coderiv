# Coderiv – Front-End Test Task

Live demo: https://coderiv.vercel.app/

## Overview

This project was developed as a **front-end test task** for Coderiv.  
The main goal was to implement a visually rich, animated landing page with smooth interactions and custom canvas-based effects.

The application is fully client-side and focuses on animation performance, layout precision, and clean component structure.

**Total development time:** ~10 hours  
**Dots animation:** ~5 hours

## Tech Stack

- **React.js (JSX)** — component-based UI
- **SCSS** — modular and maintainable styling
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** — advanced animations and transitions
- **Canvas** — interactive dots animation

---

## Key Features

- Responsive layout
- Smooth GSAP-driven animations
- Custom interactive dots animation rendered on `<canvas>`
- Mouse interaction effects
- Clean and scalable component structure
- Optimized rendering for animation performance

## Dots Animation

One of the core parts of the task is a **custom dots animation**, implemented using the Canvas API.

Features of the animation:
- Pixel-based image sampling
- Dynamic point generation
- Mouse interaction with configurable radius
- Smooth transitions and repulsion effects
- Performance-optimized redraw loop

This part required the most time due to fine-tuning animation smoothness and interaction behavior.
